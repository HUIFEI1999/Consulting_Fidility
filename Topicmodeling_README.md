Topic Modeling Project

Overview

This topic modeling project analyzes IMDB Movie Review dataset (50000 reviews) from Kaggle collected by Standford. 
The IMDB dataset contains movie reviews along with their associated binary sentiment polarity labels. 
It is intended to serve as a benchmark for sentiment classification. But for our analysis, we focus more on topic identification instead of sentiment analysis, so we don't split these reviews for cross validation.

Dataset

Reference: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews

The core dataset contains 50,000 reviews split evenly into 25k train and 25k test sets. The overall distribution of labels is balanced (25k
pos and 25k neg). In the entire collection, no more than 30 reviews are allowed for any given movie because reviews for the same movie tend to have correlated ratings.
